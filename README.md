# chat-application
This project is a simple client-server chat application built with Python. 
It consists of:
Chat Server: Handles client connections, receives messages, and responds dynamically. Supports commands like "exit" or "stop" to shut down the server.
Chat Client: Provides a GUI using Tkinter, allowing users to send and receive messages. The client automatically closes when "exit" or "stop" is sent.
Key Features:
Real-time messaging with threading support.
Dynamic responses for common messages like "hello", "time", and "date."
Graceful shutdown with "exit" or "stop" commands.
User-friendly GUI for the client with a scrollable chat area.
